This program is a connect 4 algorithm that I started making for a school project, but I didn't struggle enough when challenging my algorithm to a match, so now I'm improving it so I'll struggle even more.
It will consider 4-in-a-rows, 3-in-a-row, and forks, picking the best option among them, and if two spaces are equally as good, it'll pick randomly. 
It won't be looking any more than one move ahead, and even then it's just barely looking ahead.
That's all. :)

In summary, this algorithm was made to be a fun challenge in connect 4.
